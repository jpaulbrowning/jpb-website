Hello!  It's nice to meet you!

I am a data and analytics researcher and practitioner.  My focus is primarily on data analysis, warehousing, and machine learning.  I have a particular interest in higher education.  Currently, I am a senior director at [EAB](http://www.eab.com), a higher education technology and consulting firm, where I work with [Edify](https://eab.com/products/edify/), a data warehousing and analytics solution.

I studied higher education administration, finishing my Ph.D. at the [University of Wyoming](http://www.uwyo.edu/) in 2021.  My research focused on the development of the institutional research and analytics functions in higher education.  My [dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ntpkB_YvK2n_EiG0n0SecYI8HglEJAse/view?usp=sharing) was a phenomenological examination of the emergence of the chief data officer at colleges and universities.  I have served on several campuses, including designing and managing the office of institutional effectiveness at [Utah Tech University](https://utahtech.edu/), and overhauling the institutional research office at the [Northern Wyoming Community College District](http://www.sheridan.edu/).  

I am passionate about operationalizing analytics and business intelligence to inform operations and strategy and to increase institutional impact.  I love to make technical topics accessible to diverse audiences and to create compelling analyses.  I enjoy creating data visualizations in [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com) and programming using [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Before the world of educational technology and higher education, I worked in banking and finance, including roles in decision support and analytics at [Discover](http://www.discover.com) and as a bank examiner and compliance officer.  I have an MBA from [Xavier University](http://www.xavier.edu) and did my undergraduate work in accounting and economics at [Bellarmine University](http://www.bellarmine.edu).

I am originally from [eastern Kentucky](http://www.flemingsburgky.org/), but now live on the [Kitsap Peninsula](https://www.visitkitsap.com/) outside of [Seattle, Washington](https://visitseattle.org/).  The beauty of the area is perfect for hiking with my two dogs, and the city of Seattle offers world-class culture and dining (and great [coffee](https://seattle.eater.com/maps/essential-coffee-shops-seattle-cafes))!

This blog is built using the [Spacebook](http://spacebook.app) starter project on [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
